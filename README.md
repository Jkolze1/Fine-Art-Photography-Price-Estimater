# Fine-Art-Photography-Price-Estimater
In this JCCC JavaScript project, I used basic math functions to create estimates on prices for a small photography studio. To do this I declared variables, then I did a calcStaff function to help figure out hours, distance, and photographer cost. Then I used a toggleMembook function to see if the checkboxes were checked, if they were that was added to the cost. I completed this project in February 2018.
